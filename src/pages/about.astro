        <p class="text-lg ml-32 mt-9">Hi there, I'm Tom! Thanks for stopping by. I'm currently working as a frontend developer at HMRC, while on my final year at Northumbria Uni studying Computer Science BSc.</p>
        <p class="text-lg ml-32 mt-6">I have a great passion for all things web, constantly trying new tools and getting side-tracked with learning them. I hope this will be evident from my projects showcase, and my blog, where I discuss primarily developer-related topics.</p>
        <p class="text-lg ml-32 mt-6">In my spare time, I like to go to the gym, read, watch TV/Movies and sometimes play video games.</p>
